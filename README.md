# Sales Forecasting Analysis with Prophet

This repository contains an analysis of sales forecasting using Python, the `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `prophet` libraries. The analysis walks through the steps of importing, visualizing, and forecasting sales data to provide insights and predictions.

## Required Libraries

- Data Manipulation:
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib.pyplot`
  - `seaborn`

- Time Series Forecasting:
  - `prophet`

## Loading the Data

The data is loaded from an Excel file named 'Data.xlsx' and is used for analysis and forecasting.

## Exploratory Analysis

The exploratory analysis includes the following steps:

1. Importing the necessary libraries.
2. Loading and initial visualization of the data.
3. Displaying the DataFrame's structure.
4. Formatting the graph for better visualization.
5. Preparing the data for Prophet modeling.

## Prophet Modeling

The analysis proceeds to forecast sales using the Prophet library:

1. Creating a DataFrame suitable for Prophet.
2. Preparing and fitting the Prophet model to the data.
3. Generating a sales forecast for a specified number of days.

## Visualization

The analysis includes visualizations of the results:

1. Graphical representation of the forecasted sales.
2. Displaying the forecasted sales values.
3. Visualizing the components of the model.

## Usage

You can use this repository to learn about time series forecasting in Python, including data manipulation, visualization, and using the Prophet library for predictions. Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your own forecasting tasks.
